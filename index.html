           <p>In 2007, a remarkable woman named Elizabeth Mumbi had a vision to create a safe haven for vulnerable children who had nowhere to call home. Having grown up in a community where children faced neglect, abandonment, and the struggles of poverty, Elizabeth felt a deep compassion for those suffering in silence. She knew something had to be done to offer these children hope and a chance for a brighter future.

            Elizabeth, despite facing her own set of challenges, began by opening her heart to the children in need. She started by helping just a few children, providing food, shelter, and emotional support. Her passion and determination were contagious, and soon enough, more children in dire circumstances found their way to her door. The makeshift shelter was humble, but it was built on the pillars of love, care, and security. and this was later called Destiny Child Care Center</p>
